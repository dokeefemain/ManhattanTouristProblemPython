This project is an implementation of a dynamic programing Algorithm that I am using to solve the famous Manhattan Tourist Problem.
The idea is pretty simple imagine you are a tourist who is trying to see the most attractions possible while you are in Manhattan. Getting this best possible path is defenatly acheavable thanks to Manhattans Grid like layout. The goal of this program is to show you the max ammount of attractions that you can visit as well as give you the path for you to see those attractions. The only input needed is the number of rows and columns and the weight of rightward attraction and downward attraction.
